This assignment reqired me to create a game that randomly selects and letter selected by the CPU.
The user then had to try and guess the Cpu letter in order to win the game.
This application also stored user last selected letter as well as display cpu letter after a win or loss result.
Difficulties included displaying user inpt on the screen and also creating the cpu generated selection.
Javascript and Html was heavily used in this processes.
